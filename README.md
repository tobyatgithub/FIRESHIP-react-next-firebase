# FIRESHIP-react-next-firebase
Use react, next, and firebase to build a blog website that supports auth, server side rendering, and history data analysis.

## Install
### node and firestore config
Make sure you are using node version 16.13.1
```
nvm install 16.13.1
nvm use 16.13.1
```

Then, we will need to add figurations to the file at `/lib/firebase.ts`.
It is a little bit annoying and I put it into the lastpass vault for myself...

### firestore console config
TBA

## Run
After installation steps, now we are ready to hold it up and run.
```bash
cd nextfire-app
npm run dev
```
